#### Submitting an issue you found
Make sure your problem does not exist as a ticket already by searching through [the existing issues](https://github.com/my-language-skills/simple-revision-cleaner/issues). If you cannot find anything which resembles your problem, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/my-language-skills/simple-revision-cleaner/issues/new).

#### Fixing an issue

* Fork the repository on GitHub (make sure to use the trunk branch, not master).
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
* Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) and you properly document any new functions, actions and filters following the [documentation standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* When committing, reference your issue and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'trunk' branch of the simple-revision-cleaner repository.

We will review your pull request and merge when everything is in order. We will help you to make sure the code complies with the standards described above.

#### 'Patch welcome' issues
Some issues are labeled 'patch-welcome'. This means we see the value in the particular enhancement being suggested but have decided for now not to prioritize it. If you however decide to write a patch for it, we'll gladly include it after some code review.
